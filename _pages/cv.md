## Professional Experience

### Automated Dice Pickup and Sorting System 
### Freelancer, UPWORK, Stockholm, Sweden

- The project aims to develop an automated system that uses a robot arm, a camera, and software tools to locate, pick up, and sort transparent red dice from a dice table.
- The dice will be picked up one at a time using a suction tool and placed into a box with 10 holes located on the table. The entire process will be guided by a webcam installed on the end of the robot arm, providing visual feedback.

*Technology Stack: C++, Python, ROS, PyTorch, OpenCV, Git*

### Start-up Project Development 
### Developer, Stockholm, Sweden

- Collaborated with a Senior Data Engineer to develop a SQL generator utilizing LLMs like chatGPT and built an AWS data platform from scratch.
- Conducted performance evaluations of generated SQL queries and created a web application to seamlessly embed the SQL generation service within the platform.

*Technology Stack: Python, AWS, SQL, Front-end development, Prompt Design for LLMs*

### Camera ISP optimization for computer vision tasks performed by DNNs 
### Master thesis intern, Scania, Södertälje, Sweden

- Working individually on the computer vision thesis project provided by Scania.
- Redefined the image segmentation task so the ISP in some way is part of the training process.
- Evaluated in what way the ISP affects the accuracy of the DNN output and if different ISP will influence the final accuracy.

*Technology Stack: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Git, AWS*

### Dual-arm collaboration based on image recognition 
### Bachelor thesis student, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China

- Object recognition and 3D localization using a depth camera and YOLOv3. A visual-hand system is built with ROS.
- Once the object location and category have been determined, MoveIt will plan the movement and collaboration of the dual-arm robots' arms. Robot arms will move following the planned trajectory to pick up cups and pour water.

*Technology Stack: PyTorch, YOLOv3, ROS, MoveIt, Python, C/C++, TCP/IP*

### Analyze the data of the floor sweeper machine 
### Data Analyst Intern, Roborock, Beijing, China

- Roborock was developing a kind of cleaning robot that can be used in a shopping mall or underground parking lots.
- Responsible for visualizing and analyzing the data gathered from sensors and the battery, checking the data for any abnormalities, and writing a daily report.

*Technology Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, ROS, Linux*
